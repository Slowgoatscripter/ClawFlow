## Implementation Plan

{{plan}}

## Previous Stage Context

{{previous_handoff}}

## Rules

- Touch ONLY what the plan requires. Do NOT improve adjacent code.
- Follow TDD: failing test → minimal implementation → passing test → commit.
- Commit after each logical unit of work.
- If the plan is ambiguous, make the conservative choice and note it in your handoff.
