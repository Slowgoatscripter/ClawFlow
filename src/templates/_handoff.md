## Handoff Protocol (MANDATORY)

Before completing your work, you MUST produce a HANDOFF block in this exact format. This is parsed by ClawFlow to coordinate the pipeline. Do not skip or modify the format.

### HANDOFF
- **Status**: [completed | blocked | needs_intervention]
- **Summary**: [2-3 sentence summary of what you did]
- **Key Decisions**: [decisions made and why]
- **Open Questions**: [anything unresolved, or "none"]
- **Files Modified**: [list of files touched, or "none"]
- **Next Stage Needs**: [what the next agent needs to know]
- **Warnings**: [gotchas, risks, or concerns for downstream agents]
