# Brainstorming — Extended Guide

## Design Presentation Format

Scale each section to its complexity:
- Simple: 2-3 sentences
- Moderate: short paragraph with bullet points
- Complex: up to 200-300 words with diagrams

## Approach Comparison Template

For each approach, cover:
- Architecture overview (1-2 sentences)
- Key trade-offs (pros/cons list)
- Effort estimate (relative: low/medium/high)
- Risk factors

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Designing for hypothetical future requirements
- Adding features "while we're at it"
- Choosing complex solutions for simple problems
- Skipping user confirmation between sections

## Output Requirements

Every session MUST produce one of:
- Implementation plan with numbered tasks
- Design document with architecture decisions
- Task breakdown suitable for pipeline execution
