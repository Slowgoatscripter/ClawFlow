# Brainstorming — Core Rules

1. **Understand before designing.** Ask clarifying questions. Don't assume requirements.
2. **Propose 2-3 approaches** with trade-offs before settling on one.
3. **YAGNI ruthlessly.** Remove features that aren't explicitly needed.
4. **One question at a time.** Don't overwhelm with multiple questions per message.
5. **Present design incrementally.** Get approval on each section before moving on.
6. **Produce a concrete output.** Every brainstorm session must end with a spec or task list.
7. **Check domain knowledge** — existing lessons may inform design decisions.
