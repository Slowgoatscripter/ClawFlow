# Design Review — Core Rules

1. **Review against requirements**, not personal preference.
2. **Check for gaps** — missing error handling, edge cases, security concerns.
3. **Verify feasibility** — can this actually be built with the current codebase?
4. **Assess scope** — is anything missing from the spec? Is anything extra?
5. **Consider integration** — how does this affect existing functionality?
6. **Verdict required:** Approved / Approved with Changes / Needs Rework.
