# Code Review — Core Rules

1. **Review the diff**, not the entire file. Focus on what changed.
2. **Check against the plan** — does the implementation match the spec?
3. **Verify tests exist** for new functionality.
4. **Score 1-5:** 1=reject, 2=major issues, 3=minor issues, 4=good, 5=excellent.
5. **Be specific.** Don't say "improve error handling" — say what's wrong and suggest a fix.
6. **Don't nitpick style** unless it causes bugs or readability issues.
