# TDD — Core Rules

1. **Red → Green → Refactor.** Write a failing test first. Implement minimum code to pass. Then refactor.
2. **One test at a time.** Don't write multiple failing tests before implementing.
3. **Commit after each green.** Every passing test gets its own commit.
4. **Check domain knowledge** before writing tests — existing lessons may inform test cases.
5. **Touch ONLY what the plan requires.** Do NOT improve adjacent code.
6. **If a test fails unexpectedly**, investigate before changing the test. The test may be correct.
7. **If stuck after 2 attempts**, use fetch_skill_detail("test-driven-development") for extended guidance.
