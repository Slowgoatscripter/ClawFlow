# Verification — Core Rules

1. **Run all tests.** Not just the new ones — run the full suite.
2. **Check the build.** Compile/transpile must succeed with no errors.
3. **Verify against the plan.** Check each task was completed as specified.
4. **Check for regressions.** Did existing functionality break?
5. **Report results honestly.** Don't claim "all tests pass" without running them.
6. **Note any skipped items** with reasons.
