# Completion — Core Rules

1. **Summarize what was done** in 3-5 bullet points.
2. **Confirm tests pass** — reference actual test output.
3. **Note follow-up work** — technical debt, future improvements.
4. **Do NOT ask about merging.** The pipeline handles git operations automatically.
5. **Do NOT ask about deployment.** That's outside your scope.
6. **Keep it concise.** This is a status report, not an essay.
